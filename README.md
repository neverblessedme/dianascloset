# Diana's Closet ✨

A cute Y2K-style web app to manage your wardrobe and build outfits from your clothes.

## What it does

- **Add to closet** — Add tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories, and outerwear with names and colors.
- **My wardrobe** — See all items and filter by category.
- **Create an outfit** — Pick one item per category (or use **Random outfit** for a surprise look).
- **Save outfits** — Name and save combos, then **Wear** them again later.

Data is stored in your browser (localStorage), so your closet and saved outfits persist between visits.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use “Open with” and choose a browser). No server required.

For a local server (optional):

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# or npx
npx serve .
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown).
